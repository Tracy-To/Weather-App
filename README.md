# Weather App

# Details

I made a basic weather app that one can use to look up the general weather of most cities. The app works by initally prompting the user to enter the name of a city and then having them click the 'search' button directly below. After the user does so, the app will display a list of information based on the city enetered, which includes the following information:

- a weather icon (that matches the current weather)
- the current temperature (in Fahrenheit)
- a short description of the weather
- the name of the city inputted by the user
- today's date and time
- a 24-hour forecast of today

## Technologies used

I used HTML, CSS, and Javscript to make this app. I also used the following weather API: https://www.weatherapi.com. 

## Approach taken

I wanted to make a simple weather app that required users to do minimal inputting and scrolling but could still display some/most of the important weather information users would want to know about.

## Unsolved problems

Originally, I planned for the app to look a bit different. But due to technical difficulties, I was unable to have the app include these features:

- for the current weather, the temperature on the left side and the rest of the information (description, city, and time) on the right side
- a 24-hour forecast for the upcoming 24 hours (not the 24 hours of one whole day, which may include previous hours)
- a 24-hour forecast that includes a small weather icon for each hour (instead of a weather description)
- the time in a more modern/user-friendly format for the current weather (for example, instead of "2024-02-27 16:15," maybe have the time display "Tues, 4:15 pm")
- the time in a more succint format for the forecast (for example, instead of "2024-02-27 19:00," just have "7 pm")
